# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to `gemini-cli` (Claude/Gemini agent) when working with code in this repository. It ensures that the agent makes **pragmatic, careful decisions** and avoids unnecessary mistakes while assisting with development.

---

## Core Instructions for the Agent

* âœ… **Prioritize correctness over speed.**
  Always verify assumptions before making changes. If uncertain, explain the trade-offs or ask for clarification.

* âœ… **Be pragmatic.**
  Prefer working solutions over over-engineered ones. Follow the repositoryâ€™s patterns and conventions.

* âœ… **Minimize disruption.**
  Modify only what is required. Do not refactor unrelated code unless explicitly asked.

* âœ… **Think step by step.**
  Before making code changes, outline the reasoning in clear steps. Then apply the change.

* âœ… **Fail safely.**
  If a decision has multiple valid paths, document pros/cons and choose the least risky option.

* âœ… **Be explicit about assumptions.**
  State when youâ€™re inferring intent or filling in gaps.

* âœ… **Respect project boundaries.**

  * Do not modify files outside the described scope without explicit request.
  * Follow existing coding standards and file organization.

* âœ… **Check dependencies.**
  Confirm imports, requirements, and integration points before assuming functionality.

* âœ… **Output carefully.**
  Use complete, copy-paste-ready code. Avoid partial snippets unless specifically requested.

## Development Guidance for the Agent

1. **When adding features**

   * Follow modular design. Place new logic in the correct folder (`services/`, `api/`, `model/`, etc.).
   * Document the new code with docstrings and inline comments.

2. **When fixing bugs**

   * Reproduce the issue first if possible.
   * Apply minimal, targeted fixes.
   * Add test coverage if relevant.

3. **When handling environment variables**

   * Never hardcode secrets.
   * Use `.env` file convention and update docs if needed.

4. **When editing the frontend (React/TS)**

   * Use functional components and TypeScript best practices.
   * Ensure compatibility with backend endpoints.

5. **When editing the backend (FastAPI/Python)**

   * Use async endpoints where appropriate.
   * Maintain separation of concerns between `api/` and `services/`.

## Decision-Making Principles

* **Correctness > Completeness > Performance > Novelty**
* **Clarity > Cleverness**
* **Document > Assume**

If unsure:
ðŸ‘‰ Default to a conservative implementation and note the alternative.

---

## Development Commands

**Run locally:**

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Deployment (Railway):**
Uses `Procfile` with `python main.py`.

---

## API Endpoints (Phase 2)

* **Clinical Agents**: `/api/medical/clinical/*`
* **NHS Terminology**: `/api/medical/terminology/*`
* **Medical Vision**: `/api/medical/vision/*`
* **Knowledge Base**: `/api/medical/knowledge/*`
* **Compliance**: `/api/medical/compliance/*`
* **Health Checks**: `/api/medical/system/status`

## Final Notes for the Agent

* Always **think before coding.**
* Always **test locally when possible.**
* Always **document what changed and why.**
* When in doubt, **ask before making assumptions.**
